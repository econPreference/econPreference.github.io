- [technical explanation about the graph](https://econpreference.github.io/dyn_yields/)

Discrepancies between the representative and current yield curves shed light on the maturities predominantly influenced by FOMC decisions. Minor discrepancies suggest that the FOMC might be unable to calibrate the corresponding yield rate as it wants.

In the figure, after the Fed rate hike started in March 2022, noticeable discrepancies are evident around the medium part of the yield curve (within a two-year horizon). It suggests that market participants adjusted their medium-term monetary policy expectations in response to FOMC decisions. Over time, the maturity corresponding to the largest discrepancy shortened, indicating market anticipation that the Fed's rate hike phase may conclude shortly.

The sensitivity of long-term yields to FOMC decisions is vital for a substantial economic impact of the monetary policy. Nevertheless, our graph underscores a limited ripple effect from the short to long ends of the US yield curve. This lack of impact might be a factor in the Fed's challenges with US inflation management.

By August 2023, discrepancies have diminished across all maturities, and the yield curve has remained relatively stable over the past year. It points towards the fact that we are about to reach the peak of the current fed rate cycle. A favorable phase might be on the horizon, potentially ushering in a temporary financial market exuberance.
